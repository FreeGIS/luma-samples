and compiled using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Building the project
requires an installation of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

- Install dependencies: `npm install`.
- For development, start the dev server which will watch and recompile
  sources: `npm start`. You can navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.
- For production, compile the project: `npm run build`.
- To run a production server to serve the built assets, do `npm run serve`.

### Example

npm run-script build   # or `npm start` and do the following in a separate terminal
npm run-script serve
```
